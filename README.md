# s3eker <img src="res/icon.png" alt="icon" width="32"/>
Find open S3 buckets by searching website source code. s3eker searches [urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io) for websites that reach out to a `s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com` subdomain. It will then attempt to list the contents of the bucket. If an open bucket is found it will alert via Slack. The theory being if a bucket is being used as a static site, it may have more relaxed permissions. Additional criteria and inputs may be added later.

s3eker runs on AWS and can be spun up using Terraform with the exception of a Secrets Manager entry for the Slack webhook. No API key is needed for urlscan.io. There are two serverless Lambda functions to run the searching and listing operations. The first Lambda is triggered by a CloudWatch event every hour. An S3 bucket is used to track previously seen domains and to trigger the second Lambda function.
